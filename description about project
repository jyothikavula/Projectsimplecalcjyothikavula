# Projectsimplecalcjyothikavula
This is a caliculator program with four basic operations of +,-,*,/ that is addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.
In this programme, i imported scanner class to take the input from the user.
To run the program continuously until the user wants to exit the prigram,i used while loop.
For each  and every operation, i used switch case statement where addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and exit for 5 different cases.
For exit case ,i used system.exit() method with a status code that indicates successfull termination of program.
